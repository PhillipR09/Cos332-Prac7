How to enable POP3 in Gmail:

Some e-mail programs do not allow one not to download those messages that you
are not interested in. In some cases such messages are very long and one spends a
lot in phone costs to download them to then simply delete them. It may therefore
be handy to have a program that shows one which mail messages are available
so that one can delete those messages that are not required before you use your
regular e-mail program to download the rest.
Write such a program that displays the sender, subject and size of all the messages waiting in your mailbox. Now make it possible to mark all those messages
that you are not interested in (using, for example, a checkbox, but simpler approaches are acceptable — the user interface is not a prime concern in a network
module). Your program then has to remove all those messages from the server
without downloading any messages.
